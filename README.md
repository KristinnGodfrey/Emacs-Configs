# Emacs-Configs

## How to use my configs?
Replace your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` and `~/.spacemacs` files with mine or simply nitpick what you like.

Evaluate code blocks with `C-x e` and run `M-x restart-org-mode` command.

## Doom > Spacemacs?
I'm making the switch from Spacemacs to Doom. Doom should give me a better programming environment with features such as a sidebar as we all have grown accustomed to with VSCode.

## Spacemacs files
I have all my configurations in the Spacemacs folder including settings for org-mode configurations, custom keybindings, export settings and inline-image dependencies for various filetypes.
