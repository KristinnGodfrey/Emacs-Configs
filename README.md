# Emacs-Configs

# How to use my configs?
Replace your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` and `~/.spacemacs` files with mine or simply nitpick what you like.

Evaluate code blocks with `M-x e` and run `M-x restart-org-mode` command.

# Emacs Doom > Spacemacs?
I'm switching to Emacs Doom from Spacemacs. Doom should give me a better programming environment with features such as a sidebar as we all have grown accustomed to from VSCode.

## Spacemacs files
I have all my configurations in the Spacemacs folder including settings for org-mode configurations, custom keybindings, export settings and inline-image dependencies and settings for various filetypes.

## Doom files
Who knows? Looks pretty cool huh?
